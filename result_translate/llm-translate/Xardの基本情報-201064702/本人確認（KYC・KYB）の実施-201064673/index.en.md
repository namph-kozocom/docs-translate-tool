In Xard, there are cases where the partner conducts KYC as part of the identity verification process and cases where KYC is not conducted under certain conditions.

KYC stands for "Know Your Customer" and refers to identity verification to prevent crimes such as money laundering. In this manual, it refers to verifying identity items in compliance with the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds.

The confirmation items in KYC and the conditions when KYC is not conducted (nonKYC) are as follows:
