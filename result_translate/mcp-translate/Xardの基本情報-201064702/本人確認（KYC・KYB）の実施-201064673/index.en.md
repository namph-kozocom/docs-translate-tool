In Xard, identity verification procedures include cases where the partner performs KYC and cases where KYC is not performed after meeting certain conditions.

KYC stands for "Know Your Customer," which refers to identity verification to prevent crimes such as money laundering. In this manual, it refers to the verification of identity items based on the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (Anti-Money Laundering Act).

The verification items in KYC and the conditions for cases where KYC is not performed (nonKYC) are as follows:

## 1. Verification Items in KYC

KYC is basically performed by the partner. In KYC under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the following identity verification items are required for the representative of the corporation and the corporation itself:

**Representative of the Corporation**

* Name

* Address

* Date of Birth

**Corporation**

* Name

* Location of the head office or principal place of business

* Detailed requirements for implementing KYC should be confirmed with the partner.

* For the requirements for implementing KYC, refer to the following page:  
  JAFIC "[Overview of the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds](https://www.npa.go.jp/sosikihanzai/jafic/hourei/law_com.htm)" "Documents and Methods Required for Identity Verification of Specified Items"

## 2. Conditions for Cases Where KYC is Not Performed (nonKYC)

Issuers of prepaid payment methods are not considered specified business operators under the Anti-Money Laundering Act and are therefore not legally obligated to perform KYC. However, in cases where KYC is not performed (nonKYC), the following usage restrictions are required by international brands:

**Visa**

* Limit per transaction: **30,000 yen**

* Monthly limit: **120,000 yen**

* Lifetime limit: **1,000,000 yen**

* Overseas in-store transactions are prohibited

**JCB**

* Limit per transaction: **100,000 yen**

* Monthly limit: **100,000 yen**

* Lifetime limit: **1,000,000 yen**

* * *

The above usage limits should be set appropriately within the range of the upper limits, considering consumer protection and prevention of misuse.
